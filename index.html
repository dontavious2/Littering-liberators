<p>This site will show and highlight the dangers of litering and why w
  
</p>As litter degrades, chemicals and microparticles are released. These chemicals arenâ€™t natural to the environment and can, therefore, cause a number of problems. For example, cigarette butts can contain chemicals such as arsenic and formaldehyde. These poisons can make their way into the soil and freshwater sources, which negatively impacts both humans and animals. In fact, 60% of water pollution is attributed to litter. </p>
<p>Animals are innocent victims affected by litter every day. Researchers estimate that over one million animals die each year after ingesting, or becoming entrapped in, improperly disposed trash.

Plastic litter is the most common killer of animals and marine animals are the most notably affected. Each year over 100,000 dolphins, fish, whales, turtles and more drown after becoming entangled in or digesting plastic litter.
